    "serving_size": 4,
    "ingredients": [
      "200g pancetta",
      "50g pecorino cheese",
      "50g parmesan",
      "3 large eggs",
      "350g spaghetti",
      "2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole",
      "50g unsalted butter",
      "sea salt",
      "freshly ground black pepper"
    ],
    "instructions": [
      "Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.",
      "Finely chop the pancetta, having first removed any rind.",
      "Finely grate both cheeses and mix them together.",
      "Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with a little freshly grated black pepper and set everything aside.",
      "Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add the spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).",
      "Squash the garlic with the blade of a knife, just to bruise it.",
      "While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic.",
      "Drop the butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.",
      "Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp.",
      "Remove and discard the garlic.",
      "Keep the heat under the pancetta on low.",
      "When the pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta.",
      "Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.",
      "Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat.",
      "Quickly pour in the eggs and cheese.",
      "Using the tongs or a long fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.",
      "Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it).",
      "You don’t want the pasta to be dry, it should be creamy and glossy.",
      "Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper."
